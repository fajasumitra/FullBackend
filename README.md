## MedEase Cloud Computing Path
We integrate and bridge the models that have been created by machine learning with the Back-End, which will produce a form that can be used by mobile applications. After that, we deploy the Back-End and the models together using Google Cloud Services.

------------

### Build With
- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en)
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)

------------

### Connecting to Server
We created an API using the Node JS programming language with the Express JS Framework for backend medicines detection and fetching datasets from Cloud SQL.

------------

### Deployment
Recognizing the need for future scalability and cost optimization, we opted for Cloud Run's serverless capabilities to power our containerized backend. Likewise, the user-friendly interface and affordability of Cloud SQL made it the perfect choice for storing vital datasets and models.
